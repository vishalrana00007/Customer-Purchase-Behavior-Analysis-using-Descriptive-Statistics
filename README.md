# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics
# Project Overview:

This project involved analyzing customer data provided by a company to gain valuable insights that can be used to optimize sales strategies. The dataset contained 2240 rows and 22 columns, encompassing a rich variety of customer demographics (date of birth, education level, marital status, number of children) and financial information (income, expenses). Additionally, it included sales data for various product categories (wines, fruits, gold products, fish products, meat products) over a two-year period.

# 1.Data Preparation:

(a)Data Loading: The initial step involved mounting the dataset from Google Drive, making it accessible for analysis.
(b)Data Cleaning: To ensure data quality, duplicate entries and rows with missing purchase amounts were meticulously removed.

# 2.Data Exploration and Analysis:

(a)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive EDA was performed on the cleansed data to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. This in-depth exploration provided a foundational understanding of the customer base and their purchasing behaviors.

(b)Descriptive Statistics: Key variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics, calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation). These statistics provided a clear picture of how the data is distributed and summarized the customer characteristics.

(c)Probability Distributions: Specific probability distributions were identified for relevant variables. Bernoulli distributions were used to model customer responses to offers and complaints. Poisson distributions were employed for analyzing purchase frequencies (number of online purchases, number of deal purchases etc.). Nominal probability distributions were applied to understand spending patterns across categories like wines, gold products, meat products and so on.

(d)Customer Segmentation: Clustering techniques were implemented to segment customers into two distinct clusters based on their purchase activity levels. This segmentation allowed for targeted analysis and the identification of groups with high and low purchase frequency.

# Expected Outcome:

Through the comprehensive analyses conducted in this project, the company is expected to gain valuable customer insights. By understanding customer demographics, spending habits, and purchase behavior patterns, the company can develop data-driven sales strategies to boost sales and achieve future growth.

# Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven insights in understanding customer behavior and optimizing sales strategies. By leveraging statistical analysis, probability distributions, and clustering techniques, the company can make informed decisions to drive business growth and enhance customer satisfaction.
